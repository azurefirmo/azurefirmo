I'm a college student living in Brazil. I'm learning to code. I love web development and small or medium systems development. It's amazing to be able to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also like to program in C# and Java, as I feel more challenged. I love it when I finally manage to solve a difficult problem or build something that I consider relevant.

For my learning programming projects, I usually only upload to Github after I've made significant progress. For markdown files, I commit much more frequently. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript Stacks.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating small and medium fullstack systems and learning how to progam.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to code, draw, read, and watch animes, movies and series in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about games and horror movies.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not a "Hello World!"
